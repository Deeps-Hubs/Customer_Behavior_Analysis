This document, "Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis," presents a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding customer purchasing patterns using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across several product categories.​

Project Overview
The analysis aims to provide actionable business insights by examining key aspects such as customer demographics, spending behavior, product preferences, and the impact of subscription status on purchases.​

Dataset and Preparation
The dataset contains 3,900 rows and 18 columns featuring details like age, gender, location, items bought, purchase amounts, discounts, and review ratings.​

Data cleaning included standardizing columns, handling missing values (notably in the review ratings), and engineering new features such as customer age groups and purchase frequency.​

Analysis Techniques
Python and PostgreSQL were used for exploratory and structured data analysis, enabling deep dives into:

Revenue breakdowns by gender and subscription status​

Identification of high-spending customers using discounts​

Product ratings, shipping preferences, and discount dependencies​

Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal groups​

Age-group revenue contributions and repeat purchase trends​

Dashboard and Recommendations
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key findings and support strategic decisions.​

The document concludes with targeted recommendations, including strategies to boost subscriptions, implement loyalty programs, manage discount policies, optimize product positioning, and focus marketing on high-value groups.​

This analysis provides a data-driven foundation for optimizing shopping experiences and guiding retail marketing initiatives
